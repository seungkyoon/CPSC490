# CPSC 490: An Exploration of the Versatility of RobustRecovery of Over-Parameterized Models
This is a repository of all code for my senior thesis (CPSC 490).

Abstract:
In the rich field of robust regression, a new concept of robust recovery of corrupted models is presented in a paper by \cite{gao2020model}. In this paper, we explore extensions and applications of the works in that paper. First, we start by proving that a simplified robust estimator without any noise, the degenerate point subset problem (c-DPS) of finding $(1-\epsilon)n$ collinear points is NP-hard for all values of $c$ where $0 < c < 1$. This indicates a likely computational bottleneck for robust estimators and may restrict the computational tractability of the model repair problem. Additionally, we show that the results of model repair on neural networks are reproducible on real colon data. This can have significant ramifications on data privacy as model repair on over-parameterized models can nearly perfectly recover the original response variables. Finally, we extend the framework of model repair to convolutional networks and find that by reformulating the convolutional network in matrix form akin to a feed-forward network, we can recover the parameters of a convolutional network with results comparable to the feed-forward case.
